# Week 2, Day 9 — Deep Learning Forecasting

## Sequential, time-aware design

Each LSTM and GRU example is a **28-day** sequence of a SKU's preceding daily demand values, transformed with `log1p`; its target is the following day's demand. The models only train on windows whose targets precede **2011-11-12**. The final 28-day validation period uses **89,505 shared SKU-date rows** from Day 6, so every model in the comparison is scored on identical actuals. The remaining **207** Day 6 rows are not represented in the sequence-feature dataset and are excluded from every Day 9 metric.

For repeatable local runtime, training uses a seeded sample of **75,000** windows from **1,748,204** eligible pre-validation windows. Both models use one recurrent layer with 32 hidden units, four epochs, Adam optimization, and predictions are transformed back to units and clipped at zero.
