# FORESIGHT Final Project Report

## Project summary

FORESIGHT is a decision intelligence application for demand forecasting, replenishment planning, and operational monitoring. The project combines processed forecast outputs with a Streamlit dashboard and adds deployment, CI/CD, and monitoring scaffolding for a more production-ready experience.

## What was delivered

- A modular Python application structure
- A Streamlit dashboard for executive and operational insights
- Configuration and logging improvements
- Dockerization and container-based local runs
- GitHub Actions CI workflow with testing, linting, and Docker build automation
- Cloud deployment scaffolding with environment-variable support and persistent data-path configuration
- Monitoring starter files for Prometheus/Grafana-like observability
- Validation and load-testing scripts for the forecasting and dashboard pipeline

## Validation evidence

The following checks were executed successfully:

- `python scripts/validate_forecast_pipeline.py`
- `python scripts/load_test_dashboard.py`
- `python -m pytest`
- `python scripts/run_quality_checks.py`

Observed results:

- Forecast validation status: `ok`
- Forecast rows detected: `17`
- Replenishment rows detected: `3204`
- Reorder-now recommendations: `2152`
- Average smoke-test latency: `0.076s`

## Recommended next steps

1. Connect the app to a real cloud storage backend for persistent model/data artifacts
2. Replace the monitoring placeholders with production metrics and alerts
3. Add a deployment workflow for Azure Container Apps or another target platform
4. Expand the forecasting validation to include SKU-level accuracy drift monitoring
