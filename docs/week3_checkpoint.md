## Completion status

The interactive dashboard suite is complete and integrated into the application entrypoint. The following pages are now available:

- Forecast accuracy
- Demand intelligence
- Replenishment actions
- Inventory intelligence
- What-If analysis

## Validation summary

The application now validates:

- Forecasting visualizations through `pages/1_Forecast_Accuracy.py`
- SKU-level inventory recommendations through `pages/2_Replenishment_Actions.py`
- Inventory health and stock risk through `pages/4_Inventory_Intelligence.py`
- Demand/lead-time scenario simulation through `pages/5_WhatIf_Analysis.py`
- Low-stock, predicted stockout, and excess inventory alerts through `pages/6_Alerts_Reporting.py`

A checkpoint validation script is included to verify data availability and pipeline outputs.
