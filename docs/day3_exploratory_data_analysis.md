# Week 1, Day 3 — Exploratory Data Analysis

## Scope and method

This analysis uses `data/processed/clean_sales_transactions.csv` and covers **2009-12-01 through 2011-12-09**. Demand is defined as the quantity on positive, non-return sales lines; return/cancellation lines are excluded because they are not future demand. Revenue is the corresponding positive-line sales revenue. The source contains **1,033,031** cleaned lines, of which **1,010,534** are included in demand.

The dataset has no SKU-category master: all demand is assigned to the cleanup placeholder `UNMAPPED`. Category performance is therefore available as a completeness check only, not as a product-family comparison. Add a validated SKU-category master before using category-level results for planning.

## Demand distribution

- **4,813 SKUs** generated **11,455,907 units** and **20,476,260.45** in positive-line revenue.
- SKU demand is strongly long-tailed: median **652** units per SKU; 75th percentile **2,182**; 95th percentile **10,078**.
- The top 10 SKUs represent **7.4%** of all units. Prioritize these products for forecast accuracy and service-level review.

### Recurring seasonality

Average demand is calculated per observed selling day, so that calendar closures do not make a weekday or month look artificially weak. The historical mix is strongest on **Thursday** (23,328 units per observed day) and in calendar month **11** (28,825 units per observed day). Treat the partial final month (December 2011 ends on the 9th) with care.

## Unusual demand spikes

`data/processed/eda_demand_outliers.csv` contains **42,530** daily SKU spikes. A spike is a SKU's active-day quantity above Q3 + 1.5 × IQR, evaluated only for SKUs with at least eight active sales days. Where IQR is zero, the threshold is the greater of twice the usual quantity and usual quantity + 20 units. This is a review queue, not proof of an error: validate campaigns, holidays, bulk orders, and data-entry issues before changing forecasts.
